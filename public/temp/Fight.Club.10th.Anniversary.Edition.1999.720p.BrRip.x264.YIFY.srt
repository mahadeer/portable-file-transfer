2
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:08,472
People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:10,422
Three minutes.

4
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:12,822
This is it. Ground zero.

5
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:16,592
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

6
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:20,231
With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.

7
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:22,401
I can't think of anything.

8
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:26,371
For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing

9
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:28,601
and I wonder how clean that gun is.

10
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:30,760
It's getting exciting now.

11
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,040
That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.

12
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,210
Well, it works both ways.

13
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,579
We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.

14
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,419
The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem

15
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,959
wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.

16
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:51,089
In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges

17
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,558
and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.

18
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:57,668
I know this because Tyler knows this.

19
00:02:57,768 --> 00:03:01,168
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

20
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:06,607
Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,

21
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:09,977
has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.

22
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:14,847
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.

23
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:19,116
This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.

24
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:22,486
The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.

25
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:24,726
We're still men.

26
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:27,016
Yes, we're men.

27
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,295
Men is what we are.

28
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:32,835
Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.

29
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:36,705
He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high

30
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:38,905
and his body upped the oestrogen.

31
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:42,704
- That was where I fit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.

32
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:45,274
..between those huge sweating tits

33
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:49,614
that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.

34
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:51,883
OK, you cry now.

35
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,543
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.

36
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:58,523
For six months, I couldn't sleep.

37
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:01,163
I couldn't sleep.

38
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:03,422
With insomnia, nothing's real.

39
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:05,592
Everything's far away.

40
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:08,862
Everything's a copy of a copy

41
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:10,992
of a copy.

42
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:18,861
When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.

43
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,031
The IBM Stellar Sphere.

44
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:23,441
The Microsoft Galaxy.

45
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:25,611
The Planet Starbucks.

46
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,240
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

47
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,880
It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.

48
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,559
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

49
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:42,259
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

50
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:46,229
He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.

51
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:52,468
Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.

52
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:54,908
Yes. I'd like to order

53
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:57,278
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

54
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:59,478
- Please hold.
- Anything clever,

55
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:03,917
like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,
I had to have it.

56
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:07,357
The Klipsk personal office unit.

57
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,717
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.

58
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:13,626
Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.

59
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:19,196
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.

60
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:22,096
I'd flip through catalogues and wonder

61
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:25,235
"What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?"

62
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:30,105
I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,

63
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:35,305
proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...

64
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:38,354
- Please hold.
- ..wherever.

65
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,944
We used to read pornography.

66
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,854
Now it was the Horchow collection.

67
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:47,354
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

68
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:49,793
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.

69
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:51,953
I have no idea how I got there.

70
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:55,833
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

71
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:59,562
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...

72
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:03,432
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

73
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:07,632
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

74
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:11,741
Hey, come on.

75
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,891
- I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

76
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,551
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

77
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:19,691
See the guys with testicular cancer.

78
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,881
That's pain.

79
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:41,179
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.

80
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:43,679
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

81
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,748
We never could agree on anything.

82
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:49,858
Well, I... She...

83
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,458
She had her first child last week.

84
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,788
A girl.

85
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:58,127
With... With her... With her new husband.

86
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,027
Fuck!

87
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:04,427
Thank God, you know...

88
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:06,597
I'm glad for her.

89
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:10,376
She deserves...

90
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:18,016
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

91
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:20,176
Thank you, Thomas.

92
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:23,725
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

93
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,885
And that gives me strength.

94
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:28,325
We give each other strength.

95
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,725
It's time for the one-on-ones.

96
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,694
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

97
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:37,854
Could you find a partner?

98
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:43,204
And this is how I met the big moosie.

99
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:48,073
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.

100
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,373
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.

101
00:07:58,582 --> 00:08:00,682
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

102
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:03,652
Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.

103
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:07,392
You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?

104
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:09,561
That was his idea.

105
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:11,731
I was a juicer.

106
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:13,931
You know, using steroids?

107
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,541
Diabonal and

108
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,941
Wisterol.

109
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,980
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

110
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,570
And now I'm bankrupt.

111
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,510
I'm divorced.

112
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,380
My two grown kids

113
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,879
won't even return my phone calls.

114
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:40,049
Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.

115
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:43,918
Go ahead,... Cornelius.

116
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:46,088
You can cry.

117
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:05,287
And then... something happened.
I let go.

118
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,456
That's really good.

119
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,626
Lost in oblivion.

120
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:12,016
Dark and silent and complete.

121
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:18,725
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.

122
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:23,255
It's OK.

123
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,735
Babies don't sleep this well.

124
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:33,934
I became addicted.

125
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,693
If I didn't say anything

126
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:52,493
people always assumed the worst.

127
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:59,392
They cried harder... then I cried harder.

128
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:12,971
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

129
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,141
I wasn't really dying.

130
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,010
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.

131
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,820
I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.

132
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,800
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

133
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,989
It moves over your body, healing you.

134
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:34,589
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe

135
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:38,369
and step forward
through the back door of the room.

136
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:41,338
Where does it lead?

137
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,548
To your cave.

138
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:45,518
Step forward

139
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:47,808
into your cave.

140
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:49,948
That's right.

141
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:53,547
You're going deeper into your cave.

142
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:56,287
And you're going to find

143
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:58,517
your power animal.

144
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,957
Slide.

145
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,136
Every evening I died.

146
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,975
And every evening I was born again.

147
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:21,635
Resurrected.

148
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:27,884
Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.

149
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:30,754
Being there, pressed against his tits,

150
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:32,924
ready to cry.

151
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,684
This was my vacation.

152
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:39,603
And she

153
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:42,333
ruined everything.

154
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,563
This is cancer, right?

155
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:49,673
This chick, Marla Singer,

156
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:52,402
did not have testicular cancer.

157
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,582
She was a liar.

158
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:56,752
She had no diseases at all.

159
00:11:56,852 --> 00:12:00,622
I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.

160
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:04,181
Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.

161
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:09,651
And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.

162
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,761
Marla,

163
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:15,330
the big tourist.

164
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,530
Her lie reflected my lie.

165
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,130
And suddenly, I felt nothing.

166
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,840
I couldn't cry. So once again,

167
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,029
I couldn't sleep.

168
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,488
Next group, after guided meditation,

169
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:42,988
after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,

170
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:46,228
I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.

171
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:50,327
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

172
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,807
I hadn't slept in four days.

173
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,767
We'll just let that dry...

174
00:12:56,877 --> 00:13:00,277
When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.

175
00:13:00,377 --> 00:13:02,866
And you're never really awake.

176
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:06,536
To begin tonight's communion,

177
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:09,346
Chloe would like to say a few words.

178
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:12,386
Oh, yeah. Chloe.

179
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:18,225
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around

180
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:20,385
being extra nice to everybody.

181
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:22,955
Well, I'm still here.

182
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,464
But I don't know for how long.

183
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:29,394
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

184
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,474
But I've got some good news.

185
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:35,304
I no longer have any fear of death.

186
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:42,983
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

187
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,113
No-one will have sex with me.

188
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:51,692
I'm so close to the end,
and all I want is to get laid for the last time.

189
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,732
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

190
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:59,531
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

191
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:02,331
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

192
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,601
Thank you, Chloe.

193
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:11,240
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.

194
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,780
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

195
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,720
You step inside your cave and you walk...

196
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,949
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.

197
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,959
Marla.

198
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:30,519
The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.

199
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,719
But you can't.

200
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,468
..deeper into your cave as you walk.

201
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:40,128
You feel a healing energy all around you.

202
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:44,838
Now find your power animal.

203
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:49,767
Slide.

204
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:56,687
OK. Let's partner up.

205
00:14:56,787 --> 00:14:59,086
Pick someone special to you tonight.

206
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:07,386
Hey.

207
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:09,855
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

208
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:16,745
- I'm onto you.
- What?

209
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:19,945
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

210
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,814
Sorry?

211
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:26,904
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, I know we're all dying.

212
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:31,214
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

213
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:33,883
So you're a tourist.

214
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:38,163
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

215
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:40,763
I saw you at testicular cancer!

216
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:42,493
I saw you practising this.

217
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:45,002
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.

218
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:48,932
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?

219
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,802
I'll expose you.

220
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:53,002
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

221
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:56,611
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

222
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:05,711
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

223
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:08,550
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

224
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,390
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

225
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,620
I've been coming for over a year.

226
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,930
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

227
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,839
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

228
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,929
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

229
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,299
Yeah. Yeah.

230
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:31,339
Share yourself... completely.

231
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,218
Look, you don't want to get into this.

232
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:36,378
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?

233
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:40,748
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.

234
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:42,888
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

235
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:46,547
Candystripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

236
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:51,787
No, wait a second. Hold on.

237
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:53,957
We'll split up the week, OK?

238
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,236
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

239
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:59,436
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

240
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:02,846
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

241
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:06,845
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

242
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:09,315
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

243
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:11,415
No. No.

244
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:14,125
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

245
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:17,015
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

246
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:21,424
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

247
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:24,264
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

248
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:26,864
So far, you have four. I only have two.

249
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:30,873
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

250
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:33,233
Now we both have three...

251
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,603
Hey! You left half your clothes.

252
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:57,291
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

253
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,451
I'm selling some clothes!

254
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,621
So! We each have three. That's six.

255
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:04,531
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

256
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:06,730
The girl had done her homework.

257
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,930
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

258
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,630
That's your favorite too?

259
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,230
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

260
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,399
Take the first and third Sunday.

261
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:21,749
Deal.

262
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:26,649
Looks like this is goodbye.

263
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,878
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

264
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,428
How's this for not making a big thing?

265
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:36,698
Hey, Marla!

266
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,168
Marla!

267
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,857
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

268
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,867
Should we?

269
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:48,037
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

270
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,706
This is how I met Marla Singer.

271
00:18:57,456 --> 00:19:01,686
Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.

272
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:04,085
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.

273
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:08,195
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

274
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:12,255
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

275
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,294
You wake up at SeaTac.

276
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:20,344
SFO. LAX.

277
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:22,804
You wake up at O'Hare.

278
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:25,014
Dallas Fort Worth.

279
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,043
BWI.

280
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:30,943
Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.

281
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:34,923
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

282
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:38,263
This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.

283
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:41,352
You wake up at Air Harbor International.

284
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:46,602
If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,

285
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:49,362
could you wake up as a different person?

286
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:51,531
Everywhere I travel,

287
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,871
tiny life.

288
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:56,471
Single-serving sugar and cream.

289
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,371
Single pat of butter.

290
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:01,281
The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.

291
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:03,350
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

292
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,320
Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.

293
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,260
The people I meet on each flight,

294
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,460
they're single-serving friends.

295
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,259
Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together.

296
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,589
That's all we get.

297
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:21,599
Welcome!

298
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:27,868
On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

299
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:31,678
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.

300
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:34,178
The infant went through the windshield.

301
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:38,317
A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.

302
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,507
The rear differential locks up.

303
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:44,117
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

304
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:46,587
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

305
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:50,186
The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.

306
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:52,526
Now, should we initiate a recall?

307
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,696
The father must have been huge.

308
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,026
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

309
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:00,106
Very modern art.

310
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,675
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.

311
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:05,475
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.

312
00:21:05,575 --> 00:21:09,345
Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.

313
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:11,535
A x B x C

314
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:13,644
equals X.

315
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:16,314
If X is less than the cost of a recall,

316
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:18,444
we don't do one.

317
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:21,724
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

318
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,754
You wouldn't believe.

319
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:27,733
Which car company do you work for?

320
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,953
A major one.

321
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:36,332
Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,

322
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:39,732
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.

323
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:41,962
Anything.

324
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:54,551
Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.

325
00:21:57,491 --> 00:22:00,760
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row

326
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,360
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties

327
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,900
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you."

328
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,739
It's a lot of responsibility.

329
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,069
Wanna switch seats?

330
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,579
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particularjob.

331
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,078
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.

332
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:25,238
The illusion of safety.

333
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:27,548
Yeah. I guess so.

334
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:30,558
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

335
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:35,217
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

336
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:39,827
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

337
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:42,437
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

338
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,837
You accept your fate.

339
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,496
It's all right here.

340
00:22:47,606 --> 00:22:50,736
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

341
00:22:50,846 --> 00:22:53,646
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

342
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:55,836
That's...

343
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:59,345
That's an interesting theory.

344
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:03,455
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

345
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:05,625
What do you do for a living?

346
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:08,885
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

347
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,034
OK.

348
00:23:13,134 --> 00:23:16,034
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

349
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,333
We have the exact same briefcase.

350
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:24,163
Soap.

351
00:23:24,273 --> 00:23:27,943
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

352
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,443
The yardstick of civilization.

353
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,912
And this is how I met...

354
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:34,822
Tyler Durden.

355
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:40,182
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

356
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:43,222
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

357
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:47,161
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

358
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,701
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.

359
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:59,730
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.

360
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,710
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

361
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,370
Thank you.

362
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,579
How's it working out for you?

363
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:12,419
- What?
- Being clever?

364
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,859
Great.

365
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:17,949
Keep it up, then. Right up.

366
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,298
A question of etiquette.

367
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:24,388
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

368
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,737
How I came to live with Tyler is...

369
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:38,137
Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

370
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:50,446
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

371
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,696
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

372
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:56,025
But when a suitcase vibrates,

373
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:58,825
the throwers have got to call the police.

374
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:02,425
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out of ten

375
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,575
it's an electric razor.

376
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:06,794
But... every once in a while

377
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:11,804
it's a dildo.

378
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:16,644
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

379
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:20,583
We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never

380
00:25:20,683 --> 00:25:22,753
your dildo.

381
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:24,953
I don't own...

382
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:30,732
I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.

383
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:33,992
My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.

384
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:38,002
Never mind.

385
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,601
Hey! That's my car!

386
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:50,881
Home was a condo on the 15th floor

387
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:53,980
of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.

388
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,710
The walls were solid concrete.

389
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,880
A foot of concrete is important

390
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,230
when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.

391
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,199
Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects

392
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,329
blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.

393
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:20,068
I suppose these things happen.

394
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:34,987
There's... nothing up there.

395
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:38,497
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

396
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,676
Do you have somebody you can call?

397
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,875
How embarrassing.

398
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:54,875
A houseful of condiments and no food.

399
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:08,084
The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out

400
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:12,024
letting out just a little bit of gas.

401
00:27:12,124 --> 00:27:14,394
That gas could have filled the condo.

402
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:17,983
1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.

403
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:29,972
Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.

404
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,132
Yeah?

405
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:38,342
I can hear you breathing...

406
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:50,930
If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.

407
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,407
- Hello?
- Who's this?

408
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:40,736
- Tyler?
- Who is this?

409
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:44,476
We met... We met on the airplane.

410
00:28:44,586 --> 00:28:46,786
We had the same suitcase?

411
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:48,955
The clever guy?

412
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:51,415
Oh, yeah. Right.

413
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:56,055
I called a second ago. There was no answer.

414
00:28:56,155 --> 00:29:00,355
- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.

415
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:05,194
So what's up?

416
00:29:05,864 --> 00:29:07,894
Well.

417
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:10,064
You're not gonna believe this.

418
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:14,413
You know, it could be worse.

419
00:29:14,513 --> 00:29:18,273
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

420
00:29:19,113 --> 00:29:22,383
There's always that. I don't know.

421
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:25,582
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.

422
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,752
That's the last sofa I'll need.

423
00:29:27,852 --> 00:29:30,622
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

424
00:29:30,722 --> 00:29:34,182
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

425
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:37,801
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

426
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,031
I was close to being complete.

427
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:42,691
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.

428
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:45,531
All gone.

429
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:48,810
Do you know what a duvet is?

430
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,780
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.

431
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,850
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?

432
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,109
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

433
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:01,819
No.

434
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,909
What are we, then?

435
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:06,589
I dunno. Consumers.

436
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:08,749
Right. We're consumers.

437
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:12,128
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

438
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:16,138
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

439
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:19,638
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

440
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:21,808
television with 500 channels,

441
00:30:21,908 --> 00:30:24,567
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.

442
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:26,737
Viagra. Olestra.

443
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:29,647
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

444
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:33,237
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

445
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:37,056
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

446
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:40,456
I say never be complete.

447
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:42,586
I say stop being perfect.

448
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:44,696
I say let's evolve.

449
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:47,095
Let the chips fall where they may.

450
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,365
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

451
00:30:51,465 --> 00:30:53,505
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

452
00:30:53,605 --> 00:30:56,075
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

453
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:59,914
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

454
00:31:00,014 --> 00:31:02,604
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

455
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,753
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

456
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:14,313
What?

457
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:17,553
The things you own end up owning you.

458
00:31:20,903 --> 00:31:22,952
Do what you like, man.

459
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:26,102
Oh, it's late.

460
00:31:26,202 --> 00:31:28,902
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

461
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:31,102
I should find a hotel.

462
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:33,911
What?

463
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:35,641
What?

464
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:37,801
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

465
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:40,951
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

466
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:44,820
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

467
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,450
What?

468
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,160
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

469
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,700
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

470
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,359
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

471
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,429
Would... Would that be a problem?

472
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,599
Is it a problem for you to ask?

473
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,839
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:09,268
Thanks.

475
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:16,438
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

476
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:18,918
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

477
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:20,957
What?

478
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:24,887
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

479
00:32:24,997 --> 00:32:27,897
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.

480
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:30,457
Tyler was a night person.

481
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,766
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

482
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:36,006
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

483
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:39,096
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

484
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:42,905
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

485
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:46,215
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

486
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:50,215
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.

487
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:53,025
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

488
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,184
That's the cue for a changeover.

489
00:32:55,284 --> 00:33:00,024
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

490
00:33:00,124 --> 00:33:02,394
Why would anyone want this shitjob?

491
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:05,634
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

492
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:09,233
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

493
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:14,333
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

494
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:18,672
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

495
00:33:25,552 --> 00:33:28,142
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

496
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:30,811
Nice, big cock.

497
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:38,361
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

498
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,730
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

499
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:57,439
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

500
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,819
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

501
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,289
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,

502
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,948
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

503
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:09,058
Go ahead, tell 'em.

504
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:11,148
You get the idea.

505
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:14,598
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

506
00:34:14,698 --> 00:34:18,037
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

507
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:22,107
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!

508
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:24,567
I don't wanna die without any scars.

509
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:28,916
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

510
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:31,276
So go crazy! Let it rip.

511
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:34,046
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

512
00:34:34,146 --> 00:34:37,206
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

513
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:39,786
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

514
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:41,925
That's right.

515
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:45,225
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

516
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:49,485
This is so fucking stupid.

517
00:35:00,374 --> 00:35:02,544
Motherfucker!

518
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:04,713
He hit me in the ear!

519
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:08,013
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

520
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:10,153
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.

521
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:11,983
No, that was perfect.

522
00:35:24,862 --> 00:35:26,991
No, it's all right.

523
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:29,931
It really hurts.

524
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:32,431
Right.

525
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,971
Hit me again.

526
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:37,201
No, you hit me. Come on!

527
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,649
We should do this again sometime.

528
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:11,668
- Where's your car?
- What car?

529
00:36:22,187 --> 00:36:24,517
I don't know how Tyler found that house

530
00:36:24,657 --> 00:36:26,886
but he said he'd been there for a year.

531
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:29,826
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.

532
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:32,326
Most of the windows were boarded up.

533
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:37,765
There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.

534
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,925
The stairs were ready to collapse.

535
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:42,525
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.

536
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:45,145
Neither would have surprised me.

537
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:48,105
Yep. That's you.

538
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:50,784
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

539
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:52,944
Yeah, thanks.

540
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:54,954
What a shithole.

541
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:57,024
Nothing worked.

542
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:04,563
Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.

543
00:37:04,693 --> 00:37:08,393
There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.

544
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:12,492
That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.

545
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:16,672
What have we here?

546
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:33,551
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

547
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,589
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.

548
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:51,899
By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.

549
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:56,279
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.

550
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:10,747
Can I be next?

551
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:17,217
All right, man.

552
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:19,317
Lose the tie.

553
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:27,736
At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.

554
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:37,085
Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.

555
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:40,015
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.

556
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:43,285
Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.

557
00:38:43,385 --> 00:38:45,954
The previous occupant had been a shut-in.

558
00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:48,124
Hey, man. What are you reading?

559
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:52,564
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

560
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,424
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,

561
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:58,973
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing."

562
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:01,143
There's a whole series of these.

563
00:39:01,243 --> 00:39:03,333
"I Am Jill's Nipples."

564
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,332
- "I Am Jack's Colon."
- "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

565
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:16,382
After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.

566
00:39:18,392 --> 00:39:20,082
What?

567
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:23,751
- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?

568
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:30,971
If you could choose,
who would you fight?

569
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:33,140
I'd fight my boss, probably.

570
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,340
Really?

571
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,780
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

572
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,940
I don't know my dad.

573
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,950
I mean, I know him, but...

574
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,379
He left when I was like, six years old.

575
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:48,469
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

576
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:50,639
He did this every six years.

577
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:54,879
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

578
00:39:55,689 --> 00:39:57,788
My dad never went to college.

579
00:39:57,888 --> 00:40:01,798
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.

580
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:06,338
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"

581
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,407
- He says, "Get ajob."
- Same here.

582
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,177
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

583
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:13,237
"Dad, now what?"

584
00:40:13,337 --> 00:40:15,447
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

585
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:19,037
You can't get married.

586
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:21,846
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

587
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:24,416
We're a generation of men raised by women.

588
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:28,816
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

589
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:38,025
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.

590
00:40:38,905 --> 00:40:42,335
But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.

591
00:40:43,534 --> 00:40:47,024
We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.

592
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,573
It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.

593
00:40:55,683 --> 00:40:57,743
Polish my Scandinavian furniture.

594
00:40:57,883 --> 00:41:02,893
I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.

595
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:06,752
I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.

596
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:08,762
But I wasn't.

597
00:41:08,892 --> 00:41:12,502
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

598
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:15,432
Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.

599
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:18,561
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

600
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,761
Absolutely.

601
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:23,141
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

602
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:26,041
Because waste is a thief.

603
00:41:26,141 --> 00:41:29,271
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

604
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:36,890
You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.

605
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,120
It was right in everyone's face.

606
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,389
Tyler and I just made it visible.

607
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:44,899
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.

608
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:47,089
Tyler and I just gave it a name.

609
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,368
Come on, you've gotta go home!

610
00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:24,926
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

611
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:49,524
Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.

612
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:51,683
Gentlemen!

613
00:42:52,463 --> 00:42:54,553
Welcome to Fight Club.

614
00:42:56,663 --> 00:42:58,823
The first rule of Fight Club is

615
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:01,303
you do not talk about Fight Club.

616
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:04,002
The second rule of Fight Club is

617
00:43:04,402 --> 00:43:07,842
you do not talk about Fight Club!

618
00:43:07,972 --> 00:43:10,212
Third rule of Fight Club.

619
00:43:10,312 --> 00:43:13,112
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

620
00:43:13,212 --> 00:43:15,951
the fight is over. Fourth rule.

621
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,351
Only two guys to a fight.

622
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:20,321
Fifth rule.

623
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:23,081
One fight at a time, fellas.

624
00:43:23,191 --> 00:43:25,631
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

625
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:29,660
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

626
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,090
And the eighth and final rule.

627
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,399
If this is your first night at Fight Club

628
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:40,599
you have to fight.

629
00:43:44,649 --> 00:43:46,709
This kid from work, Ricky,

630
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:51,308
couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.

631
00:43:51,418 --> 00:43:53,788
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes

632
00:43:53,888 --> 00:43:57,258
when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.

633
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:04,457
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.

634
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:11,237
Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...

635
00:44:11,337 --> 00:44:13,357
Stop!

636
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:16,336
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.

637
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:21,246
But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.

638
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:24,776
Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,

639
00:44:24,886 --> 00:44:27,185
I wouldn't be talking to the same man.

640
00:44:27,285 --> 00:44:30,585
Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.

641
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:35,695
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.

642
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:38,664
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.

643
00:44:39,494 --> 00:44:42,664
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

644
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,894
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

645
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:49,933
Hemingway. You?

646
00:44:50,573 --> 00:44:53,733
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

647
00:44:54,773 --> 00:44:58,013
We all started seeing things differently.

648
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:02,612
Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.

649
00:45:05,952 --> 00:45:09,092
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,

650
00:45:09,192 --> 00:45:13,261
trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.

651
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:15,491
Is that what a man looks like?

652
00:45:16,401 --> 00:45:19,231
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

653
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:21,391
Now, self-destruction...

654
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,491
Excuse me.

655
00:45:58,138 --> 00:46:01,307
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.

656
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:03,467
It wasn't about words.

657
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:08,867
The hysterical shouting was in tongues

658
00:46:08,987 --> 00:46:10,946
like at a Pentecostal Church.

659
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:17,556
- Is that it?
- Stop!

660
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:20,526
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.

661
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:22,525
But nothing mattered.

662
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:25,395
Cool.

663
00:46:25,495 --> 00:46:28,295
Afterwards, we all felt saved.

664
00:46:29,235 --> 00:46:31,505
Hey, man. How about next week?

665
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:33,665
How about next month?!

666
00:46:33,775 --> 00:46:35,804
Irvine, you're in the middle.

667
00:46:35,904 --> 00:46:37,964
New guy, you too.

668
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,874
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.

669
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:44,074
He fell down some stairs.

670
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:46,813
I fell down some stairs.

671
00:46:48,653 --> 00:46:53,323
Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.

672
00:46:53,423 --> 00:46:55,893
OK. Any historical figure.

673
00:46:55,993 --> 00:46:57,862
I'd fight Gandhi.

674
00:46:58,492 --> 00:47:00,332
Good answer.

675
00:47:00,432 --> 00:47:02,632
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

676
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:05,332
Lincoln?

677
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:09,031
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

678
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,001
Fuck!

679
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:15,871
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

680
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,350
Hello?

681
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,830
Where have you been the last eight weeks?

682
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,260
Marla?

683
00:47:33,229 --> 00:47:36,359
- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.

684
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:39,439
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

685
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:42,729
We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?

686
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:45,638
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

687
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:49,248
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

688
00:47:49,348 --> 00:47:51,178
I found a new one.

689
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:53,978
- Really?
- It's for men only.

690
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:55,678
Like the testicle thing?

691
00:47:59,457 --> 00:48:01,457
Look, this is a bad time.

692
00:48:01,557 --> 00:48:03,987
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

693
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:07,626
- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.

694
00:48:07,726 --> 00:48:10,096
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

695
00:48:10,196 --> 00:48:12,466
I took what was left of a bottle.

696
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:14,636
It might have been too much.

697
00:48:14,736 --> 00:48:18,366
Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.

698
00:48:18,506 --> 00:48:22,965
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

699
00:48:23,075 --> 00:48:25,975
So you're staying in tonight, then?

700
00:48:26,085 --> 00:48:28,885
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

701
00:48:28,985 --> 00:48:33,514
Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?

702
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:38,414
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

703
00:49:04,722 --> 00:49:09,551
Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.

704
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:17,621
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

705
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,990
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

706
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:32,779
What are you doing here?

707
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:37,549
What?

708
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:40,079
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

709
00:49:42,488 --> 00:49:44,478
Fuck you!

710
00:49:59,107 --> 00:50:02,467
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

711
00:50:02,577 --> 00:50:04,546
Limber, though.

712
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:06,636
Silly cooze.

713
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:10,416
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

714
00:50:10,516 --> 00:50:12,586
Guess who's on the other end?

715
00:50:12,686 --> 00:50:14,876
I knew the story before he told me.

716
00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:20,755
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

717
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:23,695
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

718
00:50:23,795 --> 00:50:27,385
Or will it just be a death hairball?

719
00:50:30,804 --> 00:50:34,774
Prepare to evacuate soul.

720
00:50:34,874 --> 00:50:36,494
Ten,

721
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:39,374
nine,... eight...

722
00:50:39,474 --> 00:50:41,703
How could Tyler, of all people,

723
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:45,643
think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?

724
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:47,383
Five,

725
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:49,073
four...

726
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:51,912
Hang on.

727
00:50:57,362 --> 00:50:59,692
You got here fast.

728
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:03,321
Did I call you?

729
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:17,140
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

730
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,780
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

731
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,459
Oh, fuck!

732
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:29,649
Somebody called the cops.

733
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:45,058
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

734
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:49,708
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

735
00:51:49,808 --> 00:51:51,967
She has lost faith in herself.

736
00:51:52,077 --> 00:51:54,877
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

737
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:59,087
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

738
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:02,986
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

739
00:52:07,796 --> 00:52:09,986
If I fall asleep,

740
00:52:10,096 --> 00:52:12,356
I'm done for.

741
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:16,505
You're gonna have to keep me up

742
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:18,675
all night.

743
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:21,075
Un-fucking-believable.

744
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:23,345
He was obviously able to handle it.

745
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:27,114
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

746
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:29,334
- Never?
- No.

747
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:32,354
You're not into her, are you?

748
00:52:32,454 --> 00:52:34,514
No! God, not at all.

749
00:52:34,614 --> 00:52:37,213
I am Jack's raging bile duct.

750
00:52:37,353 --> 00:52:39,253
Are you sure? You can tell me.

751
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:41,223
Believe me, I'm sure.

752
00:52:41,363 --> 00:52:44,623
- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.

753
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:47,463
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

754
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:53,062
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

755
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:54,832
My God.

756
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:58,272
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

757
00:52:58,412 --> 00:53:00,841
How could Tyler not go for that?

758
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:04,471
The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.

759
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,351
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

760
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:10,041
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

761
00:53:10,151 --> 00:53:12,990
She invaded my support groups
and now my home.

762
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,180
Hey, hey. Sit down.

763
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,700
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.

764
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,599
Why would I...

765
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:30,069
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.

766
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:32,809
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

767
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,009
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?

768
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:38,508
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

769
00:53:40,018 --> 00:53:43,988
If only I had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,

770
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:46,178
none of this would have happened.

771
00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:54,027
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

772
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:03,106
I could have moved to another room.

773
00:54:04,236 --> 00:54:08,046
On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.

774
00:54:08,146 --> 00:54:10,236
But I didn't.

775
00:54:34,463 --> 00:54:38,563
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

776
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:40,733
Wanna finish her off?

777
00:54:43,643 --> 00:54:47,172
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.

778
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:50,612
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

779
00:54:50,712 --> 00:54:53,982
I became the calm little center of the world.

780
00:54:54,652 --> 00:54:56,712
I was the Zen master.

781
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:03,851
I wrote little haiku poems.

782
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,791
I e-mailed them to everyone.

783
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:08,990
Is that your blood?

784
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,760
Some of it, yeah.

785
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:15,510
You can't smoke in here.

786
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,680
Take the rest of the day off.

787
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,280
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

788
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,499
Get yourself together.

789
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,209
I got right in everyone's hostile face.

790
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:27,809
"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."

791
00:55:27,919 --> 00:55:29,979
"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."

792
00:55:30,089 --> 00:55:31,949
"I am enlightened."

793
00:55:33,888 --> 00:55:39,018
You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,

794
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:42,188
move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,

795
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:46,167
and you have to come home to this.

796
00:55:56,816 --> 00:56:00,216
- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.

797
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:04,516
We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.

798
00:56:04,616 --> 00:56:05,886
Yes.

799
00:56:05,986 --> 00:56:10,895
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

800
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:13,655
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.

801
00:56:13,765 --> 00:56:15,735
No, I wasn't aware of that.

802
00:56:15,835 --> 00:56:17,825
I am Jack's cold sweat.

803
00:56:17,935 --> 00:56:20,164
Does this sound strange to you?

804
00:56:20,264 --> 00:56:23,104
Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.

805
00:56:23,204 --> 00:56:25,234
- The dynamite
- Dynamite?

806
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:28,434
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

807
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:31,983
- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?

808
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:33,983
It means it was home-made.

809
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:38,323
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

810
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:43,962
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

811
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:47,132
- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?

812
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:49,282
- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.

813
00:56:49,432 --> 00:56:53,802
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.

814
00:56:53,902 --> 00:56:55,971
Excuse me. Are you there?

815
00:56:56,071 --> 00:56:58,971
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.

816
00:56:59,071 --> 00:57:03,541
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

817
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:05,910
- Enemies?
- Reject civilization,

818
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,070
especially material possessions.

819
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:11,020
- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.

820
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,710
- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.

821
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,620
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

822
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,449
That condo was my life. OK?

823
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:23,089
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.

824
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:26,199
That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.

825
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:29,169
- It was me!
- I'd like to thank the Academy.

826
00:57:29,268 --> 00:57:33,298
- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!

827
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:37,248
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

828
00:57:37,348 --> 00:57:42,217
- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

829
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:46,307
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

830
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:48,817
- OK?
- OK.

831
00:57:51,487 --> 00:57:56,116
Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.

832
00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:59,266
My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.

833
00:57:59,366 --> 00:58:03,126
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

834
00:58:03,236 --> 00:58:06,135
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

835
00:58:06,235 --> 00:58:08,275
You... dance all night.

836
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:10,465
Then you throw it away.

837
00:58:10,705 --> 00:58:13,335
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

838
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,344
What?

839
00:58:21,184 --> 00:58:23,984
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

840
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,954
It was worth every penny.

841
00:58:26,054 --> 00:58:28,113
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

842
00:58:29,093 --> 00:58:32,263
Someone loved it intensely

843
00:58:32,363 --> 00:58:34,383
for one day.

844
00:58:34,493 --> 00:58:36,593
Then tossed it.

845
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,522
Like a Christmas tree.

846
00:58:40,672 --> 00:58:42,762
So special.

847
00:58:42,872 --> 00:58:44,272
Then

848
00:58:44,372 --> 00:58:46,172
bam!

849
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,332
It's on the side of the road.

850
00:58:48,912 --> 00:58:51,002
Tinsel still clinging to it.

851
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:55,121
Like a sex crime victim.

852
00:58:55,221 --> 00:58:57,311
Underwear inside out.

853
00:58:57,991 --> 00:59:01,821
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.

854
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:04,620
You can borrow it sometime.

855
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:13,730
Get rid of her.

856
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,399
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.

857
00:59:17,509 --> 00:59:21,699
I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.

858
00:59:23,709 --> 00:59:27,278
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

859
00:59:27,378 --> 00:59:32,008
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

860
00:59:34,188 --> 00:59:37,058
Gotta get off

861
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:38,417
Thanks. Bye.

862
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:44,467
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

863
00:59:45,227 --> 00:59:49,067
Gonna get, need to get...

864
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:51,196
Gotta get...

865
00:59:53,406 --> 00:59:54,836
You kids!

866
00:59:56,846 --> 00:59:59,316
Why do you still waste time with her?

867
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:01,715
I'll say this about Marla.

868
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:04,075
At least she's trying to hit bottom.

869
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:05,475
And I'm not?

870
01:00:05,585 --> 01:00:08,385
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

871
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:10,585
What are we doing tonight?

872
01:00:11,255 --> 01:00:13,484
Tonight... we make soap.

873
01:00:14,464 --> 01:00:15,584
Really?

874
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:18,524
To make soap, first we render fat.

875
01:00:37,412 --> 01:00:39,642
The salt balance has to be just right

876
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:42,272
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

877
01:00:43,092 --> 01:00:46,182
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

878
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:56,291
Pay dirt!

879
01:00:56,401 --> 01:01:00,230
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

880
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,400
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

881
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:16,279
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

882
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,858
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

883
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:28,028
Like in Boy Scouts.

884
01:01:28,128 --> 01:01:31,928
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

885
01:01:34,268 --> 01:01:37,807
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

886
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:40,277
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

887
01:01:40,377 --> 01:01:44,217
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

888
01:01:44,317 --> 01:01:48,146
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

889
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,286
Tyler was full of useful information.

890
01:01:50,386 --> 01:01:54,346
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

891
01:01:54,456 --> 01:01:56,476
- You know why?
- No.

892
01:01:59,325 --> 01:02:03,095
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

893
01:02:03,195 --> 01:02:06,395
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

894
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:08,905
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

895
01:02:09,005 --> 01:02:13,804
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

896
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:15,964
May I see your hand, please?

897
01:02:21,344 --> 01:02:24,583
What is this?

898
01:02:24,683 --> 01:02:27,253
This is a chemical burn.

899
01:02:27,353 --> 01:02:30,853
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

900
01:02:30,953 --> 01:02:33,582
Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.

901
01:02:34,392 --> 01:02:37,162
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

902
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:42,402
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

903
01:02:42,502 --> 01:02:45,471
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

904
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:48,471
I tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh.

905
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:51,741
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

906
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:54,481
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

907
01:02:54,581 --> 01:02:58,610
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

908
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,710
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

909
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,559
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

910
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:11,159
I am not!

911
01:03:11,259 --> 01:03:14,249
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.

912
01:03:14,369 --> 01:03:17,529
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

913
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:23,768
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

914
01:03:23,878 --> 01:03:27,948
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.

915
01:03:28,048 --> 01:03:31,588
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

916
01:03:31,688 --> 01:03:34,647
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

917
01:03:34,747 --> 01:03:37,247
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

918
01:03:37,357 --> 01:03:41,847
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

919
01:03:42,997 --> 01:03:46,486
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!

920
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:48,656
First, you have to give up.

921
01:03:48,766 --> 01:03:51,466
First, you have to know, not fear,

922
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:54,536
know that some day, you're gonna die.

923
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:56,865
You don't know how this feels!

924
01:04:00,815 --> 01:04:05,115
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

925
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:09,204
OK.

926
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:24,493
Congratulations.

927
01:04:24,603 --> 01:04:27,503
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

928
01:04:30,543 --> 01:04:33,572
Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.

929
01:04:33,672 --> 01:04:35,642
God knows what they charged.

930
01:04:35,742 --> 01:04:38,982
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

931
01:04:39,082 --> 01:04:41,142
It was beautiful.

932
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:45,121
We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.

933
01:04:46,121 --> 01:04:48,191
He was wearing his yellow tie.

934
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:50,551
I didn't wear a tie to work any more.

935
01:04:50,661 --> 01:04:54,260
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club."

936
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,920
I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.

937
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,500
"The second rule..." Is this yours?

938
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:05,929
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

939
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:08,469
You find this. What would you do?

940
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,079
Well, I gotta tell you,

941
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:18,848
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

942
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:22,218
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

943
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:26,778
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap

944
01:05:26,928 --> 01:05:29,757
and then stalk from office to office

945
01:05:29,857 --> 01:05:34,897
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

946
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:39,457
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

947
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:43,476
This might be someone
you've known for years.

948
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:46,676
Someone very, very close to you.

949
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:50,176
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.

950
01:05:51,186 --> 01:05:53,255
And I used to be such a nice guy.

951
01:05:53,355 --> 01:05:56,685
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

952
01:06:00,525 --> 01:06:04,185
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

953
01:06:05,134 --> 01:06:07,684
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

954
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:17,603
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

955
01:06:17,703 --> 01:06:21,643
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

956
01:06:22,613 --> 01:06:24,803
I don't know about this, Marla.

957
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:26,613
Please.

958
01:06:26,713 --> 01:06:30,712
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.

959
01:06:32,752 --> 01:06:36,762
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.

960
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:38,962
Where are they, exactly?

961
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:43,161
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

962
01:06:43,261 --> 01:06:45,331
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

963
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:47,531
Thanks for the thought.

964
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,170
What happened to your hand?

965
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,430
Oh, nothing.

966
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,600
Right there?

967
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:59,340
- Feel anything?
- No.

968
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:01,440
Well, make sure.

969
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,549
OK, I'm pretty sure.

970
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:05,639
You feel nothing?

971
01:07:05,749 --> 01:07:08,049
No, nothing.

972
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:12,419
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

973
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:17,198
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

974
01:07:17,298 --> 01:07:19,368
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

975
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:22,958
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

976
01:07:23,068 --> 01:07:25,168
Well, thanks, anyway.

977
01:07:30,177 --> 01:07:32,477
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

978
01:07:32,577 --> 01:07:34,777
See you... around.

979
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,095
Cornelius?

980
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,555
Cornelius!

981
01:07:56,665 --> 01:07:59,355
It's me! Bob!

982
01:07:59,465 --> 01:08:00,895
Hey, Bob.

983
01:08:04,464 --> 01:08:07,434
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

984
01:08:07,534 --> 01:08:11,564
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

985
01:08:11,674 --> 01:08:15,163
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

986
01:08:15,283 --> 01:08:19,013
- I got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

987
01:08:19,683 --> 01:08:21,523
Well...

988
01:08:21,623 --> 01:08:25,882
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

989
01:08:25,992 --> 01:08:28,092
And the second rule is

990
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:30,462
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

991
01:08:30,562 --> 01:08:33,992
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

992
01:08:34,132 --> 01:08:36,192
Look at my face, Bob.

993
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:40,901
That's fucking... fucking great.

994
01:08:41,001 --> 01:08:44,711
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

995
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:48,540
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

996
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:51,280
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

997
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:54,010
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

998
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:57,020
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

999
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:00,719
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

1000
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:04,219
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

1001
01:09:04,329 --> 01:09:06,519
He's a great man.

1002
01:09:07,999 --> 01:09:10,329
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1003
01:09:35,286 --> 01:09:37,356
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1004
01:09:37,456 --> 01:09:39,526
Actually, you did.

1005
01:09:39,626 --> 01:09:41,686
Thank you for this.

1006
01:09:41,966 --> 01:09:44,336
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1007
01:09:44,436 --> 01:09:46,486
Fight Club.

1008
01:09:46,595 --> 01:09:48,695
This was mine and Tyler's gift.

1009
01:09:48,905 --> 01:09:50,865
Our gift to the world.

1010
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:54,305
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

1011
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:58,105
Shut up!

1012
01:09:58,245 --> 01:10:03,084
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1013
01:10:11,423 --> 01:10:15,483
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1014
01:10:15,593 --> 01:10:17,633
I see all this potential.

1015
01:10:17,733 --> 01:10:19,823
And I see it squandered.

1016
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:23,922
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1017
01:10:24,502 --> 01:10:26,572
Waiting tables.

1018
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:28,732
Slaves with white collars.

1019
01:10:31,242 --> 01:10:34,301
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1020
01:10:34,411 --> 01:10:37,681
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1021
01:10:41,551 --> 01:10:43,991
We're the middle children of history.

1022
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:46,150
No purpose or place.

1023
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,450
We have no Great War.

1024
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,850
No Great Depression.

1025
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:54,960
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1026
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:58,769
Our great depression is our lives.

1027
01:11:01,639 --> 01:11:04,679
We've all been raised
on television to believe

1028
01:11:04,779 --> 01:11:08,449
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

1029
01:11:08,548 --> 01:11:10,618
But we won't.

1030
01:11:10,718 --> 01:11:13,148
We're slowly learning that fact.

1031
01:11:13,288 --> 01:11:15,688
And we're very, very pissed off.

1032
01:11:15,788 --> 01:11:17,448
Yeah!

1033
01:11:20,357 --> 01:11:24,797
- First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

1034
01:11:30,297 --> 01:11:31,557
Who are you?

1035
01:11:32,396 --> 01:11:34,996
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

1036
01:11:35,906 --> 01:11:38,736
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

1037
01:11:39,806 --> 01:11:43,675
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

1038
01:11:43,775 --> 01:11:45,875
Tyler Durden.

1039
01:11:48,985 --> 01:11:52,455
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1040
01:11:52,555 --> 01:11:54,895
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

1041
01:11:54,995 --> 01:11:57,584
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1042
01:11:57,694 --> 01:11:59,814
He don't own this place. I do.

1043
01:12:01,994 --> 01:12:05,464
- How much money's he getting for this?
- There is no money.

1044
01:12:05,564 --> 01:12:08,333
- Free to all.
- Ain't that something?

1045
01:12:08,433 --> 01:12:10,273
It is, actually.

1046
01:12:10,373 --> 01:12:12,803
Look, stupid fuck!

1047
01:12:12,903 --> 01:12:15,433
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey!

1048
01:12:15,543 --> 01:12:17,773
You should join our club.

1049
01:12:18,143 --> 01:12:20,112
Did you hear what I just said?

1050
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:22,342
You and your friend.

1051
01:12:24,222 --> 01:12:26,342
You hear me now?

1052
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:30,611
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1053
01:12:36,761 --> 01:12:38,751
Still not getting it.

1054
01:12:39,801 --> 01:12:41,931
OK, OK, I got it.

1055
01:12:42,031 --> 01:12:44,530
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1056
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,440
Back! All of you!

1057
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,200
Everybody back!

1058
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:00,849
Ah, Lou!

1059
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:04,619
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

1060
01:13:13,668 --> 01:13:16,598
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

1061
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:18,497
Oh, yeah!

1062
01:13:23,477 --> 01:13:25,567
Is that fucking funny?

1063
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:37,716
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.

1064
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:40,246
Unbelievable.

1065
01:13:44,495 --> 01:13:47,435
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1066
01:13:47,535 --> 01:13:50,435
You don't know where I've been!

1067
01:13:53,504 --> 01:13:56,574
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1068
01:13:56,674 --> 01:13:59,104
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1069
01:13:59,204 --> 01:14:02,044
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1070
01:14:02,144 --> 01:14:04,133
On my mother's eyes.

1071
01:14:13,293 --> 01:14:15,413
Thanks, Lou.

1072
01:14:16,722 --> 01:14:18,822
You too, big guy.

1073
01:14:22,762 --> 01:14:24,862
We'll see you next week.

1074
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:43,940
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1075
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:48,890
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1076
01:14:52,129 --> 01:14:54,289
You're gonna start a fight

1077
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:56,489
and you're gonna lose.

1078
01:14:58,469 --> 01:15:00,399
Excellent choice, sir.

1079
01:15:02,968 --> 01:15:06,268
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1080
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,298
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.

1081
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:13,978
Son of a bitch!

1082
01:15:14,078 --> 01:15:18,817
Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.

1083
01:15:19,757 --> 01:15:21,817
Excuse me!

1084
01:15:21,927 --> 01:15:25,617
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...

1085
01:15:25,727 --> 01:15:27,626
Jay! Go call 911!

1086
01:15:30,366 --> 01:15:32,426
Put the hose down.

1087
01:15:32,536 --> 01:15:34,586
Stop it! Stop it!

1088
01:15:36,236 --> 01:15:38,135
Sorry.

1089
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:56,124
We need to talk.

1090
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:00,454
OK.

1091
01:16:00,554 --> 01:16:02,613
Where to begin?

1092
01:16:02,723 --> 01:16:04,893
With your constant absenteeism?

1093
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,533
With your unpresentable appearance?

1094
01:16:07,633 --> 01:16:09,653
You're up for review.

1095
01:16:09,763 --> 01:16:12,932
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1096
01:16:13,032 --> 01:16:14,942
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1097
01:16:15,042 --> 01:16:17,912
You're the Department of Transportation,
OK?

1098
01:16:18,012 --> 01:16:21,672
Someone informs you that this company

1099
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:25,841
installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,

1100
01:16:25,951 --> 01:16:29,321
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1101
01:16:29,421 --> 01:16:33,851
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1102
01:16:33,961 --> 01:16:35,791
What then?

1103
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,160
Are you threatening me?

1104
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,060
- No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

1105
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:45,570
I have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.

1106
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,740
In exchange for my salary,

1107
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,669
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1108
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:56,039
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

1109
01:16:57,309 --> 01:17:01,438
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1110
01:17:06,718 --> 01:17:10,248
- Security!
- I am Jack's smirking revenge.

1111
01:17:19,237 --> 01:17:21,327
What the hell are you doing?

1112
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:32,636
That hurt.

1113
01:17:34,086 --> 01:17:36,145
Why would you do that?

1114
01:17:36,815 --> 01:17:39,805
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1115
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,254
What are you doing?

1116
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,404
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1117
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:58,603
For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.

1118
01:17:58,703 --> 01:18:00,293
No!

1119
01:18:24,731 --> 01:18:29,191
Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,

1120
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:32,761
something horrible had been growing.

1121
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:33,900
Look.

1122
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,710
Give me the paychecks, like I asked,
and you won't ever see me again.

1123
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,610
Then, at our most excellent
moment together...

1124
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,409
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

1125
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:49,609
Telephone, computer,

1126
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:54,859
fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.

1127
01:18:54,959 --> 01:18:57,328
We now had corporate sponsorship.

1128
01:18:57,428 --> 01:19:02,598
This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.

1129
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:08,827
Now, the center of Fight Club
became the two men fighting.

1130
01:19:08,937 --> 01:19:12,397
The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.

1131
01:19:14,177 --> 01:19:18,687
Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel

1132
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:21,046
over the urine content of their soup.

1133
01:19:26,226 --> 01:19:29,216
I am Jack's wasted life.

1134
01:19:36,965 --> 01:19:39,025
Thank you, sir.

1135
01:19:40,535 --> 01:19:43,524
Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.

1136
01:19:43,634 --> 01:19:46,164
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.

1137
01:20:25,311 --> 01:20:29,011
- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

1138
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,990
There's one in Penns Grove too.

1139
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:35,320
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1140
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,480
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1141
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:41,080
No.

1142
01:21:29,945 --> 01:21:32,135
- Stop for a second.
- Hey, what are we doing?

1143
01:21:32,245 --> 01:21:34,245
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1144
01:21:34,345 --> 01:21:36,775
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1145
01:21:36,885 --> 01:21:38,885
Human sacrifice.

1146
01:21:38,985 --> 01:21:42,284
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun.

1147
01:21:42,384 --> 01:21:44,754
- What are you doing?
- Meet me in the back.

1148
01:21:44,854 --> 01:21:47,184
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1149
01:21:47,294 --> 01:21:49,064
On a long enough time line,

1150
01:21:49,164 --> 01:21:52,064
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

1151
01:21:53,063 --> 01:21:55,093
What are you doing? Come on!

1152
01:21:55,193 --> 01:21:58,603
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.

1153
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:03,673
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1154
01:22:04,472 --> 01:22:07,672
- Small, cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know?

1155
01:22:07,782 --> 01:22:10,372
They give shitty apartments letters.

1156
01:22:10,482 --> 01:22:13,572
Raymond! You're going to die.

1157
01:22:13,682 --> 01:22:15,122
No!

1158
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:19,381
Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

1159
01:22:19,491 --> 01:22:21,721
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1160
01:22:21,821 --> 01:22:25,381
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Oh, come on!

1161
01:22:25,491 --> 01:22:29,400
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

1162
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,500
- S... S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

1163
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,690
Were the midterms hard?

1164
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,400
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1165
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:41,999
- Why?
- I don't know.

1166
01:22:42,109 --> 01:22:45,099
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!

1167
01:22:46,509 --> 01:22:50,449
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?

1168
01:22:52,148 --> 01:22:54,208
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!

1169
01:22:54,318 --> 01:22:56,718
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1170
01:22:56,828 --> 01:22:59,758
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1171
01:22:59,858 --> 01:23:02,418
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1172
01:23:02,527 --> 01:23:04,967
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1173
01:23:05,067 --> 01:23:09,507
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1174
01:23:09,607 --> 01:23:11,227
Please, no.

1175
01:23:15,346 --> 01:23:17,396
I'm keeping your license.

1176
01:23:18,646 --> 01:23:21,636
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1177
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:24,736
If you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,

1178
01:23:24,856 --> 01:23:26,945
you will be dead.

1179
01:23:28,825 --> 01:23:30,875
Now run on home.

1180
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:37,684
Run, Forrest, run!

1181
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:41,424
I feel ill.

1182
01:23:42,234 --> 01:23:44,294
Imagine how he feels.

1183
01:23:44,404 --> 01:23:46,464
Come on, this isn't funny!

1184
01:23:46,574 --> 01:23:48,974
What the fuck was the point of that?!

1185
01:23:49,074 --> 01:23:53,173
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

1186
01:23:53,273 --> 01:23:57,643
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1187
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:01,152
You had to give it to him.

1188
01:24:01,252 --> 01:24:03,592
- Come on.
- He had a plan.

1189
01:24:03,692 --> 01:24:07,122
And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.

1190
01:24:07,222 --> 01:24:09,122
No fear. No distractions.

1191
01:24:09,222 --> 01:24:12,522
The ability to let that which does not matter

1192
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:14,621
truly slide.

1193
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,140
You are not your job.

1194
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,450
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1195
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:39,249
You're not the car you drive.

1196
01:24:39,759 --> 01:24:42,589
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1197
01:24:42,689 --> 01:24:45,029
You're not your fucking khakis.

1198
01:24:47,868 --> 01:24:51,528
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1199
01:25:00,377 --> 01:25:02,567
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1200
01:25:03,377 --> 01:25:05,467
You don't have to go.

1201
01:25:06,987 --> 01:25:09,077
Whatever.

1202
01:25:10,187 --> 01:25:13,276
No, I mean... It's OK.

1203
01:25:22,796 --> 01:25:24,925
Are you still going to groups?

1204
01:25:25,605 --> 01:25:27,695
Yeah.

1205
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:31,265
Chloe's dead.

1206
01:25:31,735 --> 01:25:33,705
Wow, Chloe.

1207
01:25:33,805 --> 01:25:35,744
When did that happen?

1208
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:38,174
Do you care?

1209
01:25:38,274 --> 01:25:41,614
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.

1210
01:25:41,914 --> 01:25:43,974
Yeah, well...

1211
01:25:44,084 --> 01:25:46,413
It was the smart move on her part.

1212
01:25:47,793 --> 01:25:49,813
Listen...

1213
01:25:51,123 --> 01:25:53,493
What are you getting out of all this?

1214
01:25:54,193 --> 01:25:56,283
What?

1215
01:25:56,393 --> 01:25:58,732
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1216
01:25:59,502 --> 01:26:01,562
Is this making you happy?

1217
01:26:03,172 --> 01:26:05,232
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1218
01:26:06,972 --> 01:26:09,072
I don't know. I don't understand.

1219
01:26:09,172 --> 01:26:12,711
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?

1220
01:26:12,811 --> 01:26:14,911
What is... What is that?

1221
01:26:15,011 --> 01:26:17,171
What do you get out of it?

1222
01:26:18,651 --> 01:26:20,721
No... That's not the same thing at all.

1223
01:26:20,821 --> 01:26:22,920
It's totally different with us.

1224
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:25,090
Us?

1225
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:27,090
What do you mean by us?

1226
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:31,060
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what?

1227
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,169
- All that noise. Hold on.
- No, wait!

1228
01:26:33,269 --> 01:26:35,969
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1229
01:26:36,069 --> 01:26:38,829
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1230
01:26:38,969 --> 01:26:42,369
- What?
- Playing doctor. What was going on there?

1231
01:26:42,469 --> 01:26:45,708
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1232
01:26:45,808 --> 01:26:47,868
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1233
01:26:48,008 --> 01:26:50,408
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1234
01:26:51,178 --> 01:26:53,988
- What is that?!
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1235
01:26:54,088 --> 01:26:56,488
My God. Who did this?

1236
01:26:56,587 --> 01:26:58,647
- A person.
- Guy or girl?

1237
01:26:58,757 --> 01:27:01,527
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1238
01:27:01,627 --> 01:27:04,197
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1239
01:27:04,297 --> 01:27:06,287
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1240
01:27:06,397 --> 01:27:07,537
Let go of me!

1241
01:27:07,637 --> 01:27:10,336
- This conversation
- This conversation

1242
01:27:10,436 --> 01:27:12,906
- is over.
- is over.

1243
01:27:13,766 --> 01:27:16,866
I just can't win with you, can I?

1244
01:27:26,215 --> 01:27:28,685
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1245
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:31,585
What is... What is all this?

1246
01:27:31,684 --> 01:27:33,784
What do you think?

1247
01:27:34,724 --> 01:27:36,824
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1248
01:27:36,924 --> 01:27:38,794
Hey!

1249
01:27:45,633 --> 01:27:47,433
Too young.

1250
01:27:47,533 --> 01:27:49,173
Sorry.

1251
01:27:49,273 --> 01:27:51,333
What's all that?

1252
01:27:51,443 --> 01:27:54,373
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1253
01:27:54,473 --> 01:27:57,102
- Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
- Applicant?

1254
01:27:57,212 --> 01:28:00,542
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

1255
01:28:00,652 --> 01:28:02,712
he may enter and begin training.

1256
01:28:02,812 --> 01:28:04,652
Training for what?

1257
01:28:10,261 --> 01:28:12,321
You think this is a game?

1258
01:28:12,431 --> 01:28:15,061
You're too young to train here, end of story.

1259
01:28:15,161 --> 01:28:17,891
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1260
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,890
Bad news, friend.

1261
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:26,240
It's not gonna happen.

1262
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,610
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1263
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:30,609
It's not the end of the world.

1264
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:32,909
Just... go away.

1265
01:28:33,779 --> 01:28:35,819
Go.

1266
01:28:35,919 --> 01:28:39,579
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1267
01:28:42,688 --> 01:28:44,748
Don't you look at me!

1268
01:28:44,858 --> 01:28:48,098
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1269
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:51,558
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1270
01:28:51,668 --> 01:28:55,187
Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.

1271
01:28:55,297 --> 01:28:58,137
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1272
01:29:05,676 --> 01:29:07,846
- Got two black shirts?
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:29:07,946 --> 01:29:10,206
- Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir.

1274
01:29:10,316 --> 01:29:13,256
- One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Yes, sir.

1275
01:29:13,356 --> 01:29:15,416
- One blackjacket.
- Yes, sir.

1276
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:18,515
- $300 personal burial money?
- Yes, sir.

1277
01:29:20,695 --> 01:29:22,755
All right.

1278
01:29:32,574 --> 01:29:34,634
You're too old, fat man.

1279
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:37,904
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1280
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:47,773
Bob! Bob!

1281
01:30:03,772 --> 01:30:06,431
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1282
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:08,671
Space monkey.

1283
01:30:08,771 --> 01:30:12,261
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1284
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,550
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1285
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:24,850
And you... You're too fucking

1286
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:26,560
blond!

1287
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:28,959
Get out of here, the both of you!

1288
01:30:29,059 --> 01:30:31,189
And so it went.

1289
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,449
Listen up, maggots.

1290
01:30:33,559 --> 01:30:35,619
You are not special.

1291
01:30:35,969 --> 01:30:39,258
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1292
01:30:39,368 --> 01:30:43,698
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

1293
01:30:43,808 --> 01:30:45,898
Tyler built himself an army.

1294
01:30:46,178 --> 01:30:49,778
We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1295
01:30:49,878 --> 01:30:53,507
We are all part of the same compost heap.

1296
01:30:54,577 --> 01:30:57,787
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?

1297
01:30:57,887 --> 01:30:59,957
To what purpose?

1298
01:31:00,057 --> 01:31:02,486
For what greater good?

1299
01:31:05,826 --> 01:31:07,886
In Tyler we trusted.

1300
01:31:13,236 --> 01:31:15,895
When he was like,
"You are not yourjob",

1301
01:31:16,005 --> 01:31:18,065
I was like, "Yeah!"

1302
01:31:19,945 --> 01:31:22,035
Hey, what's all this?

1303
01:31:22,145 --> 01:31:24,235
Hey!

1304
01:31:25,715 --> 01:31:27,384
OK!

1305
01:31:27,484 --> 01:31:29,814
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1306
01:31:29,914 --> 01:31:32,444
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1307
01:31:36,454 --> 01:31:38,613
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1308
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:46,093
The same great taste, Pepsi.

1309
01:31:48,463 --> 01:31:50,672
Ssh!

1310
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:54,572
Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.

1311
01:31:54,672 --> 01:31:57,612
Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?

1312
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:01,941
We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism in the city

1313
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:05,171
somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.

1314
01:32:05,281 --> 01:32:09,481
We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.

1315
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:14,760
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene

1316
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:19,090
- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.

1317
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,990
Back to you in the studio.

1318
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,500
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1319
01:32:24,469 --> 01:32:26,959
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1320
01:32:34,309 --> 01:32:36,308
What the fuck did you guys do?

1321
01:32:36,408 --> 01:32:40,508
Arson investigators
are on the premises...

1322
01:32:44,288 --> 01:32:48,817
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1323
01:32:55,027 --> 01:32:57,537
The victory in the war against crime

1324
01:32:57,637 --> 01:32:59,706
will not come overnight.

1325
01:32:59,806 --> 01:33:04,336
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1326
01:33:04,436 --> 01:33:09,346
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...

1327
01:33:09,446 --> 01:33:11,435
I gotta take a piss.

1328
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:14,285
These are the first steps in a long journey.

1329
01:33:14,385 --> 01:33:16,955
That is why we have created Project Hope.

1330
01:33:17,055 --> 01:33:19,145
Bob.

1331
01:33:22,255 --> 01:33:25,024
Project Hope will be ajoint effort

1332
01:33:25,124 --> 01:33:27,854
between the police and community leaders.

1333
01:33:27,964 --> 01:33:32,124
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1334
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:21,709
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- His balls are ice cold.

1335
01:34:23,719 --> 01:34:27,019
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1336
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:30,489
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or

1337
01:34:30,589 --> 01:34:32,889
these guys are gonna take your balls.

1338
01:34:33,788 --> 01:34:37,568
They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.

1339
01:34:37,668 --> 01:34:39,398
Look.

1340
01:34:39,498 --> 01:34:42,568
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1341
01:34:42,668 --> 01:34:46,227
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1342
01:34:46,337 --> 01:34:50,067
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1343
01:34:54,517 --> 01:34:57,306
Do not fuck with us.

1344
01:35:04,726 --> 01:35:06,846
Ball check!

1345
01:35:21,174 --> 01:35:23,264
Bob, you're this way.

1346
01:35:24,374 --> 01:35:26,674
Let's go.

1347
01:35:26,774 --> 01:35:29,974
I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.

1348
01:35:31,084 --> 01:35:33,143
Hey!

1349
01:35:47,662 --> 01:35:48,922
Yeah!

1350
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:24,469
I felt like putting a bullet in every panda

1351
01:36:24,569 --> 01:36:28,429
that wouldn't screw to save its species.

1352
01:36:30,568 --> 01:36:33,338
I wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers

1353
01:36:33,438 --> 01:36:36,308
and smother those French beaches
I'd never see.

1354
01:36:39,578 --> 01:36:42,047
I wanted to breathe smoke.

1355
01:36:59,436 --> 01:37:01,556
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1356
01:37:03,266 --> 01:37:06,205
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

1357
01:37:09,745 --> 01:37:11,775
Get him to a fucking hospital.

1358
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:13,965
Yeah.

1359
01:37:24,754 --> 01:37:27,814
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1360
01:37:29,293 --> 01:37:31,423
After you, Mr Durden.

1361
01:37:32,363 --> 01:37:34,453
After you.

1362
01:37:52,211 --> 01:37:54,781
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1363
01:37:54,881 --> 01:37:58,111
Yeah, why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1364
01:37:58,221 --> 01:38:01,191
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1365
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:03,690
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

1366
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:08,970
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.

1367
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:13,440
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1368
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:17,769
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1369
01:38:17,869 --> 01:38:21,309
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.

1370
01:38:21,409 --> 01:38:23,849
Fuck that. You should have told me.

1371
01:38:24,679 --> 01:38:26,669
Hey, Tyler!

1372
01:38:28,518 --> 01:38:30,988
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?!

1373
01:38:31,088 --> 01:38:33,558
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?

1374
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:36,258
- Oh...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1375
01:38:36,358 --> 01:38:39,027
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1376
01:38:39,127 --> 01:38:41,757
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1377
01:38:43,527 --> 01:38:47,237
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1378
01:38:47,337 --> 01:38:50,806
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1379
01:38:50,906 --> 01:38:52,966
and especially about you and me.

1380
01:38:54,146 --> 01:38:56,306
What is that supposed to mean?

1381
01:38:59,716 --> 01:39:01,876
What are you doing?

1382
01:39:02,785 --> 01:39:05,485
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?

1383
01:39:05,585 --> 01:39:08,455
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1384
01:39:08,555 --> 01:39:10,895
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1385
01:39:10,995 --> 01:39:13,395
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1386
01:39:13,525 --> 01:39:16,554
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1387
01:39:16,664 --> 01:39:20,264
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?

1388
01:39:20,364 --> 01:39:22,674
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1389
01:39:22,774 --> 01:39:25,204
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1390
01:39:26,473 --> 01:39:28,733
Jesus Christ!

1391
01:39:29,473 --> 01:39:31,573
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1392
01:39:31,683 --> 01:39:33,713
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!

1393
01:39:33,813 --> 01:39:36,473
I am sick of all your shit!

1394
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,482
OK, man.

1395
01:39:40,282 --> 01:39:42,812
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1396
01:39:42,922 --> 01:39:45,662
- Steer!
- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!

1397
01:39:45,762 --> 01:39:50,891
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1398
01:39:51,501 --> 01:39:53,021
What?

1399
01:39:53,131 --> 01:39:57,031
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.

1400
01:39:57,131 --> 01:40:00,830
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1401
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:04,400
Let go!

1402
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:06,600
All right. Fine.

1403
01:40:07,450 --> 01:40:09,380
Fine.

1404
01:41:07,775 --> 01:41:10,205
I'd never been in a car accident.

1405
01:41:10,305 --> 01:41:13,744
This must have been
what all those people felt like

1406
01:41:13,844 --> 01:41:17,014
before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.

1407
01:41:17,114 --> 01:41:19,204
Goddamn!

1408
01:41:22,713 --> 01:41:25,883
We've just had a near-life experience!

1409
01:41:29,723 --> 01:41:31,713
In the world I see,

1410
01:41:31,823 --> 01:41:35,692
you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

1411
01:41:35,792 --> 01:41:38,792
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1412
01:41:40,802 --> 01:41:45,132
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1413
01:41:45,242 --> 01:41:49,781
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1414
01:41:49,881 --> 01:41:54,411
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1415
01:41:54,511 --> 01:41:58,050
laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane

1416
01:41:58,150 --> 01:42:00,450
of some abandoned superhighway.

1417
01:42:13,899 --> 01:42:16,129
Feel better, champ.

1418
01:42:33,487 --> 01:42:35,257
And then...

1419
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:36,887
Tyler?

1420
01:42:36,987 --> 01:42:39,077
..Tyler was gone.

1421
01:42:46,466 --> 01:42:48,486
Was I asleep?

1422
01:42:49,566 --> 01:42:51,596
Had I slept?

1423
01:42:51,736 --> 01:42:54,766
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1424
01:42:54,876 --> 01:42:57,275
The house had become a living thing.

1425
01:42:57,375 --> 01:43:02,005
Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.

1426
01:43:02,515 --> 01:43:05,105
So many people moving, the house moved.

1427
01:43:07,984 --> 01:43:10,054
Planet Tyler.

1428
01:43:10,154 --> 01:43:12,214
I had to hug the walls.

1429
01:43:12,324 --> 01:43:15,414
Trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.

1430
01:43:15,524 --> 01:43:19,294
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!

1431
01:43:19,394 --> 01:43:21,923
Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.

1432
01:43:24,173 --> 01:43:26,223
Hang on a second.

1433
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:47,851
It's under control, sir.

1434
01:43:50,321 --> 01:43:52,131
Where's Tyler?

1435
01:43:52,231 --> 01:43:55,220
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1436
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:57,260
Right... OK.

1437
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:01,800
I'm all alone.

1438
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:05,600
My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.

1439
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:07,969
I am Jack's broken heart.

1440
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:15,979
What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.

1441
01:44:16,889 --> 01:44:20,078
The second rule is you do not ask questions.

1442
01:44:22,888 --> 01:44:25,588
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1443
01:44:25,998 --> 01:44:28,048
Who are all these people?

1444
01:44:33,297 --> 01:44:35,597
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1445
01:44:37,167 --> 01:44:39,227
Can I come in?

1446
01:44:42,376 --> 01:44:44,406
He's not here.

1447
01:44:44,506 --> 01:44:46,776
What?

1448
01:44:47,816 --> 01:44:51,356
Tyler isn't here.

1449
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:53,505
Tyler went away.

1450
01:44:53,985 --> 01:44:56,045
Tyler's gone.

1451
01:45:13,074 --> 01:45:14,804
Get some help!

1452
01:45:25,953 --> 01:45:30,822
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1453
01:45:30,922 --> 01:45:33,322
What happened? What happened?

1454
01:45:33,422 --> 01:45:36,292
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.

1455
01:45:37,562 --> 01:45:39,632
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1456
01:45:39,732 --> 01:45:42,251
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1457
01:45:42,971 --> 01:45:46,131
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1458
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:54,910
We had it all worked out, sir.

1459
01:46:03,090 --> 01:46:06,349
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1460
01:46:06,459 --> 01:46:09,189
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1461
01:46:10,689 --> 01:46:13,129
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1462
01:46:18,498 --> 01:46:20,498
Oh, God!

1463
01:46:20,598 --> 01:46:23,878
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1464
01:46:23,978 --> 01:46:28,077
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1465
01:46:28,177 --> 01:46:30,877
What did you think was gonna happen?!

1466
01:46:32,617 --> 01:46:36,987
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!

1467
01:46:37,087 --> 01:46:39,926
- Bury him.
- What?

1468
01:46:40,026 --> 01:46:42,256
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1469
01:46:42,356 --> 01:46:45,226
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off!

1470
01:46:45,326 --> 01:46:48,526
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?

1471
01:46:48,626 --> 01:46:51,225
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1472
01:46:51,335 --> 01:46:54,505
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1473
01:46:54,605 --> 01:46:57,595
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1474
01:46:57,705 --> 01:46:59,705
- This is Bob.
- Sir, in...

1475
01:46:59,805 --> 01:47:01,915
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1476
01:47:02,015 --> 01:47:04,004
Now, you listen to me.

1477
01:47:04,114 --> 01:47:08,604
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1478
01:47:08,714 --> 01:47:10,614
- Robert Paulsen.
- He's a man

1479
01:47:10,714 --> 01:47:13,554
and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?

1480
01:47:14,223 --> 01:47:16,523
I understand.

1481
01:47:18,763 --> 01:47:22,093
In death, a member of Project Mayhem

1482
01:47:22,193 --> 01:47:24,253
has a name.

1483
01:47:24,403 --> 01:47:27,332
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1484
01:47:27,772 --> 01:47:29,862
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1485
01:47:30,632 --> 01:47:33,302
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1486
01:47:33,402 --> 01:47:37,241
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1487
01:47:37,341 --> 01:47:40,381
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.

1488
01:47:40,481 --> 01:47:43,071
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1489
01:47:43,181 --> 01:47:46,241
Shut up! This is all over with!

1490
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:52,010
Get the fuck out of here.

1491
01:48:20,718 --> 01:48:25,157
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1492
01:48:25,257 --> 01:48:26,817
I need to see you...

1493
01:48:31,327 --> 01:48:35,367
I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.

1494
01:48:35,467 --> 01:48:40,206
I didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.

1495
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:44,866
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.

1496
01:48:45,006 --> 01:48:46,606
I wish I could help you,

1497
01:48:46,706 --> 01:48:49,045
sir.

1498
01:48:54,315 --> 01:48:56,415
Every city I went to,

1499
01:48:57,455 --> 01:48:59,854
as soon as I set foot off the plane

1500
01:49:00,454 --> 01:49:02,724
I knew a Fight Club was close.

1501
01:49:02,824 --> 01:49:04,484
Hey! Hey!

1502
01:49:05,564 --> 01:49:07,154
Taxi!

1503
01:49:07,264 --> 01:49:09,324
Look at my face. I'm a member.

1504
01:49:09,434 --> 01:49:11,953
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1505
01:49:12,063 --> 01:49:15,733
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you

1506
01:49:15,833 --> 01:49:20,533
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture,... be able.

1507
01:49:21,243 --> 01:49:24,902
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1508
01:49:26,282 --> 01:49:31,312
Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.

1509
01:49:34,092 --> 01:49:38,491
Was I asleep? Had I slept?

1510
01:49:38,591 --> 01:49:40,861
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?

1511
01:49:42,261 --> 01:49:45,301
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

1512
01:49:45,401 --> 01:49:49,640
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1513
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:52,760
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1514
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:56,930
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr Durden building an army?

1515
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:00,069
I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.

1516
01:50:00,879 --> 01:50:02,939
Everywhere I went,

1517
01:50:03,079 --> 01:50:05,019
I felt I'd already been there.

1518
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:08,019
It was like following an invisible man.

1519
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:11,178
The smell of dried blood,

1520
01:50:11,288 --> 01:50:14,778
dirty, bare footprints circling each other.

1521
01:50:15,628 --> 01:50:18,828
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.

1522
01:50:18,928 --> 01:50:22,487
The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.

1523
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:26,307
I was always just one step behind Tyler.

1524
01:50:29,207 --> 01:50:32,337
His name is Robert Paulsen...

1525
01:50:36,946 --> 01:50:39,046
Welcome back, sir.

1526
01:50:40,016 --> 01:50:42,086
How have you been?

1527
01:50:42,186 --> 01:50:44,326
Do you know me?

1528
01:50:44,425 --> 01:50:46,825
Is this a test, sir?

1529
01:50:46,925 --> 01:50:48,755
No. This is not a test.

1530
01:50:48,855 --> 01:50:51,125
You were in here last Thursday.

1531
01:50:51,665 --> 01:50:53,965
Thursday?

1532
01:50:54,065 --> 01:50:58,024
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1533
01:50:58,664 --> 01:51:00,764
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1534
01:51:03,444 --> 01:51:05,574
Who do you think I am?

1535
01:51:05,674 --> 01:51:08,233
Are you sure this isn't a test?

1536
01:51:08,343 --> 01:51:10,243
No, this is not a test.

1537
01:51:10,343 --> 01:51:12,403
You're Mr Durden.

1538
01:51:13,753 --> 01:51:16,383
You're the one who gave me this.

1539
01:51:16,483 --> 01:51:20,682
Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.

1540
01:51:32,171 --> 01:51:34,201
- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.

1541
01:51:34,301 --> 01:51:36,271
- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?

1542
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:37,701
Had sex?

1543
01:51:37,811 --> 01:51:39,971
What kind of stupid question is that?

1544
01:51:40,071 --> 01:51:42,411
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?

1545
01:51:42,511 --> 01:51:45,110
- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...

1546
01:51:45,210 --> 01:51:49,080
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1547
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:52,560
- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?

1548
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:55,489
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

1549
01:51:55,589 --> 01:51:58,489
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1550
01:51:58,599 --> 01:52:01,429
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1551
01:52:01,529 --> 01:52:04,199
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1552
01:52:04,299 --> 01:52:06,368
We just lost cabin pressure.

1553
01:52:06,468 --> 01:52:07,938
What did you just say?

1554
01:52:08,038 --> 01:52:10,368
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!

1555
01:52:10,468 --> 01:52:14,138
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?

1556
01:52:14,238 --> 01:52:16,298
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1557
01:52:16,408 --> 01:52:19,177
You broke your promise.

1558
01:52:19,277 --> 01:52:21,217
Jesus, Tyler.

1559
01:52:21,317 --> 01:52:24,747
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?

1560
01:52:24,847 --> 01:52:28,307
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.

1561
01:52:28,427 --> 01:52:30,716
Why do people think that I'm you?

1562
01:52:31,296 --> 01:52:33,346
Answer me!

1563
01:52:35,726 --> 01:52:37,556
Sit.

1564
01:52:40,366 --> 01:52:43,065
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1565
01:52:43,175 --> 01:52:45,335
I think you know.

1566
01:52:45,475 --> 01:52:48,035
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1567
01:52:48,145 --> 01:52:50,845
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1568
01:52:50,945 --> 01:52:53,744
I... I don't know.

1569
01:52:58,514 --> 01:53:01,384
- You got it.
- No.

1570
01:53:01,484 --> 01:53:03,584
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1571
01:53:04,953 --> 01:53:06,983
Because...

1572
01:53:08,363 --> 01:53:09,523
Say it!

1573
01:53:11,193 --> 01:53:13,233
Because we're the same person.

1574
01:53:13,333 --> 01:53:15,433
That's right.

1575
01:53:15,533 --> 01:53:17,672
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.

1576
01:53:17,772 --> 01:53:21,472
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1577
01:53:21,572 --> 01:53:23,642
You could not do this on your own.

1578
01:53:23,742 --> 01:53:25,802
All the ways you wish you could be,

1579
01:53:25,912 --> 01:53:27,772
that's me.

1580
01:53:27,882 --> 01:53:31,011
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.

1581
01:53:31,111 --> 01:53:33,451
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,

1582
01:53:33,551 --> 01:53:36,291
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1583
01:53:36,391 --> 01:53:37,381
Oh, no.

1584
01:53:37,491 --> 01:53:40,390
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1585
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:42,790
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

1586
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:44,900
People do it every day.

1587
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,530
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1588
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:51,899
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1589
01:53:55,709 --> 01:53:59,039
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1590
01:53:59,179 --> 01:54:03,838
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.

1591
01:54:03,948 --> 01:54:06,438
If this is your first time, you have to fight.

1592
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:10,918
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become

1593
01:54:11,758 --> 01:54:13,658
Tyler Durden.

1594
01:54:13,758 --> 01:54:16,527
You are not yourjob
or how much money you have!

1595
01:54:16,627 --> 01:54:19,027
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1596
01:54:19,127 --> 01:54:22,727
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1597
01:54:22,827 --> 01:54:24,627
Or you stay up and make soap.

1598
01:54:24,737 --> 01:54:29,666
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.

1599
01:54:31,406 --> 01:54:33,436
Oh, my God.

1600
01:54:34,446 --> 01:54:36,516
Now you see our dilemma.

1601
01:54:36,616 --> 01:54:38,875
She knows too much.

1602
01:54:38,975 --> 01:54:44,075
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1603
01:54:44,215 --> 01:54:46,345
What... What are you saying?

1604
01:54:47,285 --> 01:54:51,524
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!

1605
01:54:51,624 --> 01:54:54,284
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1606
01:54:54,394 --> 01:54:57,094
We simply do not have time for this crap.

1607
01:54:58,604 --> 01:55:00,764
It's called a changeover.

1608
01:55:00,864 --> 01:55:02,933
The movie goes on

1609
01:55:03,033 --> 01:55:06,163
and nobody in the audience has any idea.

1610
01:55:19,122 --> 01:55:22,792
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1611
01:55:22,892 --> 01:55:25,321
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

1612
01:55:29,731 --> 01:55:33,791
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

1613
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:43,730
Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?

1614
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:48,709
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?

1615
01:55:51,219 --> 01:55:53,649
Is anybody here?

1616
01:55:56,319 --> 01:55:58,419
Déjà vu all over again.

1617
01:56:00,059 --> 01:56:02,548
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1618
01:56:04,898 --> 01:56:06,958
Oh, my God.

1619
01:56:10,868 --> 01:56:13,237
- 1888.
- Who am I calling?

1620
01:56:13,667 --> 01:56:17,337
1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?

1621
01:56:18,507 --> 01:56:20,077
Hello?

1622
01:56:20,177 --> 01:56:22,277
1888 Franklin Street?

1623
01:56:22,377 --> 01:56:24,476
Yes. Can I help you?

1624
01:56:26,916 --> 01:56:29,486
- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.

1625
01:56:29,586 --> 01:56:32,086
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.

1626
01:56:32,186 --> 01:56:34,296
- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.

1627
01:56:34,396 --> 01:56:37,555
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1628
01:56:37,665 --> 01:56:39,725
It's under control, sir.

1629
01:56:40,165 --> 01:56:43,725
- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.

1630
01:56:47,974 --> 01:56:49,334
2160.

1631
01:56:56,944 --> 01:56:59,473
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1632
01:57:01,153 --> 01:57:03,923
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1633
01:57:04,023 --> 01:57:08,183
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!

1634
01:57:08,323 --> 01:57:11,022
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

1635
01:57:11,122 --> 01:57:15,062
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1636
01:57:15,162 --> 01:57:19,122
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1637
01:57:22,371 --> 01:57:24,911
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1638
01:57:25,011 --> 01:57:27,131
You have every right to be...

1639
01:57:27,741 --> 01:57:29,611
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1640
01:57:29,711 --> 01:57:32,651
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

1641
01:57:32,751 --> 01:57:34,750
Why is it free of charge?

1642
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:36,890
- Don't ask.
- Whatever.

1643
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:42,490
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

1644
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:44,650
Clean food, please.

1645
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:47,759
In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.

1646
01:57:47,859 --> 01:57:49,959
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1647
01:57:51,429 --> 01:57:53,659
You got about 30 seconds.

1648
01:57:56,369 --> 01:57:58,858
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1649
01:57:58,968 --> 01:58:02,378
- I know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides?

1650
01:58:02,478 --> 01:58:07,518
- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
- I know. But I realized something important.

1651
01:58:07,618 --> 01:58:11,677
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear

1652
01:58:11,787 --> 01:58:14,117
to me for reasons I won't go into.

1653
01:58:14,217 --> 01:58:16,787
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1654
01:58:16,887 --> 01:58:19,597
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

1655
01:58:19,697 --> 01:58:21,966
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.

1656
01:58:22,066 --> 01:58:24,126
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1657
01:58:24,226 --> 01:58:28,536
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1658
01:58:28,636 --> 01:58:30,736
You do?

1659
01:58:30,836 --> 01:58:32,705
I really do.

1660
01:58:32,805 --> 01:58:37,105
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1661
01:58:37,205 --> 01:58:39,945
Marla, your life is in danger.

1662
01:58:40,045 --> 01:58:41,945
What?

1663
01:58:42,045 --> 01:58:45,754
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.

1664
01:58:45,854 --> 01:58:48,624
- Just go camping...
- You're an insane person.

1665
01:58:48,724 --> 01:58:52,154
- No. I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1666
01:58:52,254 --> 01:58:54,814
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1667
01:58:56,623 --> 01:59:01,033
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1668
01:59:01,133 --> 01:59:04,173
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.

1669
01:59:04,273 --> 01:59:06,203
You're spectacular in bed.

1670
01:59:06,303 --> 01:59:07,732
But

1671
01:59:07,842 --> 01:59:09,892
you're intolerable.

1672
01:59:10,002 --> 01:59:12,502
You have very serious emotional problems.

1673
01:59:12,612 --> 01:59:16,542
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.

1674
01:59:16,652 --> 01:59:20,601
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

1675
01:59:21,751 --> 01:59:23,821
I can't do this any more.

1676
01:59:23,921 --> 01:59:25,991
I can't.

1677
01:59:26,091 --> 01:59:28,151
And I won't.

1678
01:59:28,261 --> 01:59:30,261
I'm gone.

1679
01:59:30,361 --> 01:59:33,050
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1680
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:38,560
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1681
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:41,160
- Marla, I am trying to protect you!
- Let go!

1682
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:44,239
- I don't ever wanna see you again!
- That's fine...

1683
01:59:44,339 --> 01:59:46,469
Here, wait right here!

1684
01:59:50,349 --> 01:59:52,879
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1685
01:59:52,979 --> 01:59:55,078
Take this money and get on this bus.

1686
01:59:55,178 --> 01:59:57,348
I promise I won't bother you again.

1687
01:59:57,488 --> 01:59:58,888
Shut up!

1688
01:59:58,988 --> 02:00:02,188
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

1689
02:00:03,358 --> 02:00:05,458
Why are you doing this?

1690
02:00:05,558 --> 02:00:09,627
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!

1691
02:00:09,727 --> 02:00:14,067
- If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
- I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.

1692
02:00:14,167 --> 02:00:18,576
- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
- Tyler.

1693
02:00:20,106 --> 02:00:22,936
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1694
02:00:37,955 --> 02:00:40,625
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1695
02:00:40,725 --> 02:00:43,464
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

1696
02:00:43,564 --> 02:00:48,504
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1697
02:00:48,604 --> 02:00:52,474
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1698
02:00:52,574 --> 02:00:56,373
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1699
02:00:56,543 --> 02:00:59,543
This is a tightly-regimented organization

1700
02:00:59,643 --> 02:01:05,242
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1701
02:01:05,352 --> 02:01:09,222
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1702
02:01:09,322 --> 02:01:11,222
That's our headquarters.

1703
02:01:11,322 --> 02:01:13,892
In the back, buried in the garden,

1704
02:01:13,992 --> 02:01:17,021
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1705
02:01:17,131 --> 02:01:20,431
In the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs

1706
02:01:20,561 --> 02:01:25,871
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1707
02:01:25,971 --> 02:01:27,971
I believe the plan is to blow up

1708
02:01:28,071 --> 02:01:31,140
the headquarters
of these credit card companies

1709
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:33,340
and the TRW building.

1710
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:37,650
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?

1711
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:41,339
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1712
02:01:42,189 --> 02:01:44,249
You'll create total chaos.

1713
02:01:45,859 --> 02:01:49,089
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone
call.

1714
02:01:59,668 --> 02:02:01,898
I really admire what you're doing.

1715
02:02:02,378 --> 02:02:04,427
What?

1716
02:02:04,577 --> 02:02:06,577
You're a brave man to order this.

1717
02:02:06,677 --> 02:02:08,437
You're a genius, sir.

1718
02:02:08,577 --> 02:02:13,277
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1719
02:02:13,387 --> 02:02:15,716
we gotta get his balls.

1720
02:02:17,116 --> 02:02:20,286
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.

1721
02:02:20,386 --> 02:02:23,396
- It will set an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1722
02:02:23,496 --> 02:02:26,326
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1723
02:02:26,426 --> 02:02:30,295
- You told us you'd say that too.
- All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1724
02:02:30,395 --> 02:02:33,095
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.

1725
02:02:33,205 --> 02:02:37,335
- We're aborting this mission now.
- You said you would definitely say that.

1726
02:02:43,474 --> 02:02:47,044
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1727
02:02:47,884 --> 02:02:49,944
Is somebody timing this?

1728
02:02:50,113 --> 02:02:53,053
Keep your mouth shut.

1729
02:02:53,153 --> 02:02:55,243
Shit!

1730
02:02:57,893 --> 02:03:00,663
Some of this information checks out.

1731
02:03:00,763 --> 02:03:04,062
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1732
02:03:04,762 --> 02:03:06,532
Hey, wait!

1733
02:03:07,232 --> 02:03:09,762
- I got him.
- Sir, we have to do this.

1734
02:03:09,872 --> 02:03:12,342
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1735
02:03:12,442 --> 02:03:14,931
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

1736
02:03:18,481 --> 02:03:21,911
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1737
02:03:23,151 --> 02:03:25,170
Get down on the floor!

1738
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:32,830
The first person
that comes out of this door

1739
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:34,890
gets a lead salad! Understand?

1740
02:03:59,218 --> 02:04:01,807
Get away! Stay away!

1741
02:04:14,766 --> 02:04:16,826
I ran.

1742
02:04:17,366 --> 02:04:21,536
I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.

1743
02:04:24,175 --> 02:04:26,235
Then I ran some more.

1744
02:05:06,952 --> 02:05:09,252
What the fuck are you doing?

1745
02:05:09,352 --> 02:05:12,291
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!

1746
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:15,481
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

1747
02:05:15,591 --> 02:05:20,491
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

1748
02:06:08,477 --> 02:06:11,136
- Oh, Christ.
- Now what are you doing?

1749
02:06:11,246 --> 02:06:14,586
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1750
02:06:14,686 --> 02:06:18,056
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1751
02:06:18,156 --> 02:06:21,385
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1752
02:06:21,485 --> 02:06:23,825
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1753
02:06:23,925 --> 02:06:25,915
The buildings are empty.

1754
02:06:26,025 --> 02:06:28,825
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

1755
02:06:28,925 --> 02:06:31,695
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1756
02:06:31,835 --> 02:06:35,164
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.

1757
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:38,864
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1758
02:06:44,913 --> 02:06:49,243
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.

1759
02:06:49,343 --> 02:06:51,073
If you know, I know.

1760
02:06:56,692 --> 02:07:01,052
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.

1761
02:07:09,571 --> 02:07:10,661
You think?

1762
02:07:12,671 --> 02:07:14,761
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1763
02:07:15,601 --> 02:07:18,601
Pull any one but the green one.

1764
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:25,970
I asked you not to do that!

1765
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:29,380
Fuck!

1766
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,409
Tyler, get away from the van.

1767
02:07:34,619 --> 02:07:38,029
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1768
02:07:38,129 --> 02:07:39,489
Goddamn it!

1769
02:07:45,838 --> 02:07:47,198
OK.

1770
02:07:47,308 --> 02:07:50,638
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1771
02:07:50,738 --> 02:07:53,338
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1772
02:07:55,547 --> 02:07:57,307
Cool it, Tyler!

1773
02:08:10,526 --> 02:08:12,556
Come on!

1774
02:08:12,656 --> 02:08:14,716
Don't go!

1775
02:08:52,303 --> 02:08:53,492
What?!

1776
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:39,669
Three minutes.

1777
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:42,908
This is it.

1778
02:09:43,018 --> 02:09:45,018
The beginning.

1779
02:09:45,118 --> 02:09:47,048
Ground zero.

1780
02:09:47,148 --> 02:09:49,418
I think this is about where we came in.

1781
02:09:49,518 --> 02:09:51,987
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

1782
02:09:52,087 --> 02:09:55,117
I'm sorry?

1783
02:09:55,227 --> 02:09:57,287
I still can't think of anything.

1784
02:09:59,327 --> 02:10:01,427
Flashback humor.

1785
02:10:06,506 --> 02:10:08,526
It's getting exciting now.

1786
02:10:10,106 --> 02:10:11,876
Two and a half.

1787
02:10:11,976 --> 02:10:14,536
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1788
02:10:14,646 --> 02:10:19,415
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1789
02:10:19,515 --> 02:10:23,245
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1790
02:10:36,804 --> 02:10:39,193
Why is she here?

1791
02:10:39,303 --> 02:10:41,203
Tying up loose ends.

1792
02:10:41,303 --> 02:10:44,363
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!

1793
02:10:44,473 --> 02:10:47,563
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this.

1794
02:10:47,673 --> 02:10:51,112
- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.

1795
02:10:51,212 --> 02:10:55,912
- I don't want this.
- Right. Except you is meaningless now.

1796
02:10:56,012 --> 02:11:00,012
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.

1797
02:11:00,122 --> 02:11:02,181
You're a voice in mine!

1798
02:11:02,291 --> 02:11:05,091
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

1799
02:11:05,191 --> 02:11:07,261
No. I don't. I really don't any more.

1800
02:11:07,361 --> 02:11:11,631
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1801
02:11:11,731 --> 02:11:15,690
- Take some responsibility.
- I do. I am responsible for all of it

1802
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:17,500
and I accept that.

1803
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:21,630
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1804
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:25,839
Have I ever let us down?

1805
02:11:27,309 --> 02:11:29,609
How far have you come because of me?!

1806
02:11:35,519 --> 02:11:37,558
I will bring us through this.

1807
02:11:37,658 --> 02:11:41,458
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming

1808
02:11:41,558 --> 02:11:43,998
and in the end you will thank me.

1809
02:11:44,468 --> 02:11:46,968
Tyler. Tyler.

1810
02:11:47,068 --> 02:11:50,567
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.

1811
02:11:50,667 --> 02:11:53,337
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1812
02:11:53,437 --> 02:11:58,707
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1813
02:11:58,807 --> 02:12:00,866
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1814
02:12:01,746 --> 02:12:05,556
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1815
02:12:05,656 --> 02:12:07,276
60 seconds till CRI.

1816
02:12:07,816 --> 02:12:09,876
No.

1817
02:12:11,786 --> 02:12:14,555
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1818
02:12:14,655 --> 02:12:18,355
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1819
02:12:19,835 --> 02:12:21,895
The gun's in my hand.

1820
02:12:26,904 --> 02:12:29,394
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1821
02:12:38,283 --> 02:12:40,913
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1822
02:12:41,053 --> 02:12:43,113
Not my head, Tyler.

1823
02:12:43,683 --> 02:12:45,713
Our head.

1824
02:12:47,262 --> 02:12:49,312
Interesting.

1825
02:12:52,332 --> 02:12:54,992
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

1826
02:13:01,471 --> 02:13:04,461
Hey. It's you and me.

1827
02:13:07,211 --> 02:13:09,271
Friends?

1828
02:13:10,111 --> 02:13:12,210
Tyler,

1829
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:17,950
I want you to really listen to me.

1830
02:13:18,090 --> 02:13:20,520
OK.

1831
02:13:20,620 --> 02:13:22,679
My eyes are open.

1832
02:13:41,438 --> 02:13:43,468
What's that smell?

1833
02:14:03,096 --> 02:14:06,086
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1834
02:14:06,736 --> 02:14:08,326
Mr Durden!

1835
02:14:09,405 --> 02:14:11,265
Oh, my God!

1836
02:14:16,615 --> 02:14:19,805
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

1837
02:14:19,915 --> 02:14:23,854
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1838
02:14:23,954 --> 02:14:27,924
- Nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1839
02:14:28,024 --> 02:14:30,784
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1840
02:14:30,924 --> 02:14:34,513
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.

1841
02:14:36,793 --> 02:14:39,023
Stop it!

1842
02:14:39,163 --> 02:14:42,263
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1843
02:14:42,363 --> 02:14:44,132
You!

1844
02:14:44,232 --> 02:14:46,332
Hi, Marla.

1845
02:14:46,802 --> 02:14:51,642
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

1846
02:14:51,742 --> 02:14:53,802
Yes, I'm sure.

1847
02:14:54,912 --> 02:14:59,011
You fucker! What kind of sick
fucking game are you playing at?!

1848
02:14:59,151 --> 02:15:01,811
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!

1849
02:15:01,921 --> 02:15:03,411
Yeah, I know.

1850
02:15:08,190 --> 02:15:10,060
What happened?

1851
02:15:10,190 --> 02:15:12,300
- Don't ask.
- You're shot.

1852
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,460
- Yes, I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

1853
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:18,430
- I can't believe he's standing.
- One tough motherfucker.

1854
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,069
Who did this?

1855
02:15:24,209 --> 02:15:26,679
I did, actually.

1856
02:15:26,779 --> 02:15:28,839
Find some gauze.

1857
02:15:30,219 --> 02:15:32,238
You shot yourself?

1858
02:15:32,348 --> 02:15:34,948
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1859
02:15:35,048 --> 02:15:37,318
I'm really OK.

1860
02:15:37,418 --> 02:15:41,378
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

1861
02:15:54,207 --> 02:15:58,066
You met me at a very strange time in my life.

1862
02:15:59,305 --> 02:16:05,217
